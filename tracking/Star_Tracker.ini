# for each of the following, the first element is the path to the shared 
#   memory, the second is the (numpy) data type in the shared memory,

# The directory path below is made in Star_Tracker_Control, so change that file
#   if changing location of shms.

# Status is represented by bits as follows:

#    bit 1      : Tracking status (0 = off, 1 = on)
#    bit 2      : Reduction       (0 = none, 1 = median filter)
