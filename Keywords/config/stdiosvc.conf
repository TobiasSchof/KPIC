# stdiosvc requires that "words" be on separate lines of the config
# file; this simplifies the parsing substantially, especially if any
# parameters include embedded whitespace. For example, say
#
#	modify
#	*
#
# ...instead of:
#
#	modify *

# Don't exit on signals. Rely instead on the
# closing of the input/output sockets.

# Don't broadcast values immediately on startup;
# without setting this option, stdiosvc will initialize
# (for example) floating point values to 0, and broadcast.

# Broadcast specific keywords regardless of whether the value doesn't appear
# to have changed. This is usually relevant for numeric keywords which
# initialize to zero, and when the DFW backend attempts to set an initial
# value of zero, it does not get broadcast by stdiosvc unless the -bcwrite
# flag is set for that keyword.
