# for each of the following, the first element is the path to the shared 
#   memory, the second is the (numpy) data type in the shared memory, and
#   the third is whether this shm should be mmapped (1 if so)
#
# The directory path below is made in Mode_Change_Control, so change that file
#   if changing location of shms.

# Shared memory to store the current position

# Status stored in bits as followed:
#    bit 0 (LSB): Script status (1 = on, 0 = off)

# Shared memory to store any error that arises
# 0 = None // 1 = MovementRange // 4 = MoveTimeout // 5 = NPS error
#   negative error is a controller error. For this stage, error codes are
