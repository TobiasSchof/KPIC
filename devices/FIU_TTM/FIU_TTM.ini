[Shm_Info]
# for each of the following, the first element is the path to the shared 
#   memory, the second is the (numpy) data type in the shared memory,
#   the third is whether the shm should be mmapped
#
# The directory path below is made in FIU_TTM_Control, so change that file if
#   changing location of shms.
