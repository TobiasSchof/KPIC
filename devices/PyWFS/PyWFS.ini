[Shm Info]
# for each of the following, the first element is the path to the shared 
#   memory, the second is the (numpy) data type in the shared memory,
#   and the third is whether this stage's information should be mmapped
#
# The directory path below is made in PyWFS_Control, so change that file
#   if changing location of shms.

# Shared memory to store the current positiom
Pos_D:  /tmp/PyWFS/POSD.shm,float32,1
# Shared memory to store the target position
Pos_P:  /tmp/PyWFS/POSP.shm,float32,1
# Shared memory to store the current status
#
# Status is represented by bits as follows:
#    bit 0 (LSB): Script status (0 = off, 1 = alive)
#    bit 1      : Device status (0 = off, 1 = on)
#    bit 2      : Referenced    (0 = not referenced, 1 = ready)
Stat_D: /tmp/PyWFS/STATUSD.shm,uint8,0
# Shared memory to store the target status. Bits defined as in Stat_D
Stat_P: /tmp/PyWFS/STATUSP.shm,uint8,0
# Shared memory to store any error that arises
#
# Error codes
#   1 = Motion Range //
# Negative error is a Conex error code. To decode, multiply by -1, add 64,
#   and convert to ascii
